  <h4>Team Beleo's Intro to Rails project</h4>
  <p>
    Our project brings a webpage where the user is able to look
    for the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
    The user can select any of those albums to check for their songs and album information,
    search for artists and even see the lyrics for those songs.
    Providing an easy navigation, our team hopes that you
    have fun when browsing through it.
